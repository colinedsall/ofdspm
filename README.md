## Outlier/Failure Detector for SPM

This is a working repository for a solution to errors presented in scanning-probe microscopes between the trace and retrace. Ideally, the difference between the values measured should be zero between the trace and retrace, but in reality they are not.

This leads to several issues with images created from the SPM, including incorrect and unclear information.

The goal of this repository is to identify a method at the image level to identify and/or reduce failure of the microscope to grant a correct image.
